it does not allow to add any record in a table that contains the foreign key unless the reference table containing a corresponding primary key.

If any record in referenced table (i.e. the table who contain primary key) is deleted, all the corresponding records in the referencing table will be deleted for the referential integrity.


//example: if we try to add a record in orders table using a non existing value agent_code which is the foreign key, that will produce this error:

* Cannot add or update a child row: a foreign key constraint fails (`test`.`orders`, CONSTRAINT `key_const` FOREIGN KEY (`agent_code`) REFERENCES `agents` (`agent_code`)) 





* select agents.agent_code, agents.agent_name, orders.ord_num, orders.advance_amount from agents join orders on agents.agent_code = orders.agent_code;
