CONVERT ANY TYPE TO ANOTHER

SELECT CONVERT(1234567890, VARCHAR(255));


DO NO TRY TO COMPARE DIFFERENT DATA TYPES

E.G.

- from the following table, write a SQL query to find those departments where more than average number of employees works. Return department name. 

* SELECT b.dep_name FROM employees a JOIN department b ON a.dep_id = b.dep_id GROUP BY a.dep_id HAVING COUNT(a.emp_id) > (SELECT AVG(aux_table.workers) FROM (SELECT COUNT(emp_id) workers FROM employees GROUP BY dep_id) aux_table);

Empty set (0.002 sec)


THE AVG MUST BE CONVERTER TO INT

* SELECT b.dep_name FROM employees a JOIN department b ON a.dep_id = b.dep_id GROUP BY a.dep_id HAVING COUNT(a.emp_id) > CONVERT((SELECT AVG(aux_table.workers) FROM (SELECT COUNT(emp_id) workers FROM employees GROUP BY dep_id) aux_table), int);
