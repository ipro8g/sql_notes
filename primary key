1) primary key could be made by multiple columns:

    CREATE TABLE Persons 
    (ID int NOT NULL,
    LastName varchar(255) NOT NULL,
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Age int,
    CONSTRAINT PK_Person PRIMARY KEY (ID,LastName)); 

In the example above there is only ONE PRIMARY KEY (PK_Person). However, the VALUE of the primary key is made up of TWO COLUMNS (ID + LastName).




2) drop

ALTER TABLE Persons DROP PRIMARY KEY;
