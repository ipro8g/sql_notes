This outer join manages to return the new employee but lost the OPERATIONS
department from the original result set. The final result set should return a row for
YODA as well as OPERATIONS, such as the following:

 DEPTNO DNAME ENAME
---------- ------------ --------
 10 ACCOUNTING CLARK
 10 ACCOUNTING KING
 10 ACCOUNTING MILLER
 20 RESEARCH ADAMS
 20 RESEARCH FORD
 20 RESEARCH JONES
 20 RESEARCH SCOTT
 20 RESEARCH SMITH
 30 SALES ALLEN
 30 SALES BLAKE
 30 SALES JAMES
 30 SALES MARTIN
 30 SALES TURNER
 30 SALES WARD
 40 OPERATIONS NULL
 NULL NULL YODA

Alternatively, since MySQL does not yet have a FULL OUTER JOIN, UNION the
results of the two different outer joins:
1 select d.deptno,d.dname,e.ename
2 from dept d right outer join emp e
3 on (d.deptno=e.deptno)
4 union
5 select d.deptno,d.dname,e.ename
6 from dept d left outer join emp e
7 on (d.deptno=e.deptno)
