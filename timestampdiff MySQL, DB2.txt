It is not necessary that both the expression are of the same type. One may be a date and another is datetime. A date value is treated as a datetime with a default time part '00:00:00'. The unit for the result is given by another argument. 

The unit should be one of the following : FRAC_SECOND (microseconds), SECOND, MINUTE, HOUR,DAY, WEEK, MONTH, QUARTER, or YEAR.

Syntax:

TIMESTAMPDIFF(year, "1958-02-20", NOW());

TIMESTAMPDIFF(unit,datetime_expr1,datetime_expr2);

 returns difference between datetime_expr1 - datetime_expr2
