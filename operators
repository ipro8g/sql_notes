1) arithmetic operators: + - / * %

    -any number data type

2) comparison operators: = <> != > < >= <=

    -for any compatible data types




3) logical operators: AND, OR, NOT, IN, BETWEEN, ANY, ALL, SOME, EXISTS, LIKE

    -ANY and SOME: TRUE if any of the subquery values meet the condition.

    -EXISTS: The EXISTS checks the existence of at least on row in result of a Subquery.

        -SELECT agent_code,agent_name,working_area,commission FROM agents WHERE exists (SELECT * FROM  customer     WHERE grade=3 AND agents.agent_code=customer.agent_code) ORDER BY commission;

        -SELECT agent_code,agent_name,working_area,commission FROM agents WHERE exists NOT (SELECT * FROM  customer     WHERE grade=3 AND agents.agent_code=customer.agent_code) ORDER BY commission;


        -difference between exists/in

            -select distinct agent_code from orders where exists(select agent_code from customer where payment_amt > 3000);

            -select distinct agent_code from orders where agent_code in(select agent_code from customer where payment_amt > 3000);

        -exists in cascade with 3 tables

            -select * from employees where exists(select department_id from departments where exists(select location_id from locations where country_id = 'uk' and departments.location_id = locations.location_id) and employees.department_id = departments.department_id);

        -using in
            
            -select distinct agent_code from orders where agent_code in(select agent_code from customer where payment_amt > 3000 and (select count(*) from customer where payment_amt > 3000) > 10);


        -insert using exists (having exaclty same structure)

            -insert into test2 select * from test3 where exists(select * from test3 where id = 2);

        -some

            -select agent_code, agent_name, working_area, comission from agents where agent_code = some(select agent_code from customer where cust_country = 'uk');






        -ALL (All the rows are inside the condition)

            - From the following tables, write a SQL query to find the country where Football EURO cup 2016 held. Return country name

            *  SELECT country_name FROM soccer_country WHERE country_id = ALL(SELECT country_id FROM soccer_city);





        -any
                
            -select agent_code, agent_name, working_area, comission from agents where agent_code = any(select agent_code from customer where cust_country = 'uk');

        -like with % (char and varchar only)
    
            -select agents.agent_code, agents.agent_name, agents.working_area, agents.comission, customer.cust_name from agents, customer where agents.agent_code = customer.agent_code and customer.cust_name like '%jack%';

        -like with _ (char and varchar only)
    
            -select agents.agent_code, agents.agent_name, agents.working_area, agents.comission, customer.cust_name from agents, customer where agents.agent_code = customer.agent_code and customer.cust_name like 'j_ck%';


            -select agents.agent_code, agents.agent_name, agents.working_area, agents.comission, customer.cust_name from agents, customer where agents.agent_code = customer.agent_code and customer.cust_name like '___k%';



4) sql unary operator

    -select * from test2 where +id; (will return all positive values for column `id`)

5) sql bitwise: & AND, | OR, ^ XOR

6) compound operators

    -   += 	Add equals
    -   -= 	Subtract equals
    -   *= 	Multiply equals
    -   /= 	Divide equals
    -   %= 	Modulo equals
    -   &= 	Bitwise AND equals
    -   ^-= Bitwise exclusive equals
    -   |*= Bitwise OR equals
