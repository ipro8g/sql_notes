-SEE ALL VIEWS INSIDE DATABASE

* SHOW FULL TABLES WHERE table_type LIKE 'VIEW';



- In RDBMS , a view is a virtual table because it does not exist in its own right, but appears to the user as if it did.

- a VIEW its an object not contains any data but represents a query and the ouput of that query represents its content

- like a query can be treated as a base table and could support all operations INSERT, DELETE, UPDATE, JOIN among with other tables or VIEWS

- a VIEW can be accesed by a SELECT statement, and can retrieve dat from multiple tables 



* create view bangalore_agents as select agent_code, agent_name from agents where working_area = 'bangalore';

* select * from bangalore_agents;

* drop view bangalore_agents;




e.g. create a view called usa comissions, for each agent compute his comission: 15% of each trait opening_amt + receive_amt from the customer table, show his name, his customer name and his comission, the cust_country must be usa

* create view usa_comissions as select agents.agent_name 'vendor name', customer.agent_code 'vendor code', customer.cust_name 'customer name', (customer.opening_amt + customer.receive_amt) 'total amount', ((customer.opening_amt + customer.receive_amt) * 0.15) 'comission 15%', customer.cust_country from agents, customer where customer.agent_code = agents.agent_code and customer.cust_country = 'usa';

* select * from usa_comissions;
